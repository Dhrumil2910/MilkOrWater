The analyst maintained a Buy rating on four big names, optimistic on growth in Macau and improving RevPAR in Vegas. 

Macau Gaming Sector 

For Macau Gaming, Citigroup maintains a bullish stance. Daswani commented, ""We remain bullish and believe the sector has been oversold. Recent sector concerns have hit valuations, and with GGR projections falling across the Street, expectations are low. Although there are few short-term upside catalysts, the lowered expectations could easily be surpassed.""

U.S. Outlook Overview

Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen lowered 2014 Macau growth estimates in a note published Tuesday. Despite near-term concerns, the analyst remains confident for long-term “Macau “mass” and Vegas “recovery” stories.” Allen believes that current levels already reflect the lowered estimates and risks.

Following a meeting in Las Vegas with gaming operators, Allen noted that the operators continue to shift more tables away from VIP to mass in Macau. The smoking ban will go into effect on October 6 and could have some short-term pressure, especially with companies that do not build the smoking rooms. The analyst noted, “None of the US operators said that they will have to remove any tables for smoking rooms.”

Morgan Stanley reported that Las Vegas is seeing more convention business, with contracts having the groups returning for two to three years. In addition, “High-end operators are feeling more comfortable pushing ADRs as mid-tier players have pushed to a point where the gap between their rates aren’t that significant that luxury travelers would choose to stay at a mid-tier property.”

Luxury properties are seeing RevPAR reaching back to peak on weekends but are still down 10 to 20 percent on weekdays. The meeting revealed ...

Although Khan admitted August and September are typically ""sloppy"" months of U.S. refining stock, he said he is moving to a ""more bullish view.""

|"Jayson Derrick"||"7/31/2014 12:18:47 PM"|"Shares Of Yelp Tumble As Analysts Offer Mixed Views"|"Shares of Yelp (NASDAQ: YELP <http://www.benzinga.com/stock/yelp#NASDAQ> ) are trading lower by 12 percent as certain aspects of the company's second quarter results were of concern.

Raymond James: Risk/Reward In Focus

Aaron Kessler <http://www.benzinga.com/topic/Aaron-Kessler>  of Raymond James focused on Yelp's growth in active local business accounts, which only rose by 5,900 in the quarter, lower than the expected 7,700 merchant heads. Kessler noted that Yelp's Other Services revenues, which includes third-party revenue streams from Google <http://www.benzinga.com/topic/google> , OpenTable <http://www.benzinga.com/topic/opentable> and other sources decelerated to $4 million, representing a 25 percent year-over-year growth, a deceleration from the 58 percent growth the company demonstrated in the previous quarter.

Kessler did note that there were plenty of positives in Yelp's quarterly report, including a 6.5 percent increase in Annual Advertising Revenue per Average Account, which came in higher than 6.0 percent he expected.

However, Kessler's projections fall short of what the company issued. Yelp's third quarter revenue guidance of $98 million to $99 million is above Kessler's estimates of $95.6 million. Yelp's third quarter EBITDA guidance of $18 million to $19 million is also above Kessler's guidance of $17.6 million.

Looking down the road, Kessler revised his full year fiscal 2015 revenue projections to $505.9 million from a previous $509.9 million given slower net advertisers add assumptions.

As a result of Yelp's risk-reward profile being “more balanced,” the analyst downgraded shares to Market Perform from Outperform with a previous $80 price target removed.

SunTrust: Strong Quarter

Robert Peck <http://www.benzinga.com/topic/robert-peck>  of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey believes that Yelp reported a strong quarter which justifies a reiteration of his Buy recommendation and a price target hike to $90 from a previous $85.

In a note to ...

Kessler noted that Yelp&#39;s Other Services revenues, which includes third-party revenue streams from <a href=""http://www.benzinga.com/topic/google"">Google</a>, <a href=""http://www.benzinga.com/topic/opentable"">OpenTable </a>and other sources decelerated to $4 million, representing a 25 percent year-over-year growth, a deceleration from the 58 percent growth the company demonstrated in the previous quarter.</p> <p>  Kessler did note that there were plenty of positives in Yelp&#39;s quarterly report, including a 6.5 percent increase in Annual Advertising Revenue per Average Account, which came in higher than 6.0 percent he expected.</p> <p>  However, Kessler&#39;s projections fall short of what the company issued. Yelp&#39;s third quarter revenue guidance of $98 million to $99 million is above Kessler&#39;s estimates of $95.6 million.

The analysts, Philip Gibbs and Tyler Kenyon, point out that stable auto sales data, PMI, ABI and rig count all confirm the steel industry is on track to achieve a three percent to five percent consumption growth rate by the end of 2014.
